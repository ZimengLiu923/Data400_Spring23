So we decided to take one of the booths that had dirty plates on it. We sat there for 15 minutes and not one of the staff stop by to clean the table or let us know they would be right with us.  Even  though two of them walk right past us more than once. We understand short staff but we would have stayed if someone would have told us they would be with us shortly or clean the table but nothing.

Kimberly's Cafe & Creamery,Deldius Centurion,1.0,4 years ago,"I walk by this place more often than I can remember...The building and the businesses name never really caught my interest, but one day as I’m walking through town early in the morning. I decide to walk and have breakfast. I did not have any real expectations...Like I said Kimberly’s Cafe & Creamery has not caught my attnention nor has anyone I know ever told me about it.I go in, I order pancakes, scrapple and a drink. I sit and wait for about twenty minutes which is not too far outside normal waiting time. The waitress brings me a plate of the food I order and my drink. The pancakes seemed undercooked if not doughy on the inside. (The texture of the pancakes felt like a wet napkin...) , but if that was not bad enough. I cannot describe the Scrapple I ordered and to top it all off the drink (Soda) I ordered was very flat. I told the waitress who apologized then came back with another drink (Which did not taste any better) Then she walks buy and brings me another soda (I did not ask for) and the flatness of that drink was worse than the first one.The only good thing I have to say about this place is the waitress who handled my order was friendly and apologized...repeatedly. Also, she did not charge me for the two extra drinks she brought me so at least I did not have to pay extra for something I did not want or ask for...Normally I put more effort into writing regardless of what I’m writing, but as I’m writing this. I really don’t care...maybe I’ll edit it later, but this review is barely worth my time.

The waitress stared us down and kept about her business until she decided she was ready to seat us (mind you there were only four other tables in the restaurant). Once we were seated, she threw the menus down on the table and walked away without saying a word. I had to call her back over to get our drink order and then she asked if we were ready and I told her no. We were o my ready for the drink order. She walked over to the kitchen and screamed back to the cook, “No, THEY aren’t ready.” At this point, I stood up and told her that we were leaving.

Issei Noodle,Be Holy,4.0,10 months ago,"My daughter, her husband, and I really like Japanese food. When she got a promotion at work she decided to celebrate at a Japanese restaurant. She found this place on the Internet. This place is small and quite crowded. There is no parking lot but there are many parking meters along the streets and we found a parking garage very close to this restaurant. It is in the downtown area of Carlisle. After we got inside the restaurant, we picked where we wanted to sit. We found the Menus on the table. After we decided what we want to order, we went to the cashier to order and paid for our food then wait at a table to be served. The food and drinks we ordered came rather fast and they were delicious. We ordered fried Gyoza and Tagoyaki for appetizers. There were 6 pieces each. I had Sakura (dry) Ramen and I enjoyed it very much. They were very good and warm. The others ordered Tatan Ramen and Miso Ramen. They also enjoyed their food. My daughter and I each had a glass of Thai tea which we didn't think it had the right aroma of Thai tea.

Issei Noodle,Jensen Re,3.0,a month ago,Drove 20 mins on a Saturday evening around 5pm and they were closed despite their hours online saying otherwise. Pretty disappointing especially after I spent another 10 mins to find parking that I paid for.Even the few times I have managed to eat there it was a pretty uncomfortable experience - being forced to share tables in tight spaces with strangers and the long line to order your food is pretty obtrusive while you’re trying to eat.Food is good and pretty authentic.. however I did have a piece of plastic in my bowl of ramen the last time I went.Why did I drive 20 mins to go back after all of that you might ask? Because it’s the ONLY ramen in south central PA. And I love me some ramen.I should open a shop!Drove 20 mins on a Saturday evening around 5pm and they were closed despite their hours online saying otherwise.

Issei Noodle,bee Johnson,4.0,4 years ago,"Nice neighborhood noodle place. I ordered the veggie udon, green tea, and mochi ice cream for dessert. My friend ordered the vegetarian vermicelli (think salad). Everything was great; love that they have a whole vegetarian conscious section of the menu. Spicy add ons are situated at the side of every table along with chopsticks and metal utensils- saves time having to ask for them. Free refills on green tea, the black sesame seed mochi was surprisingly delicious. This place closes around 2pm and reopens at 5 at which  time they seem to get busy pretty quickly. Off street parking like every other place on this street so it can be kind of difficult to get close to. Overall enjoyed my experience and would recommend.Nice neighborhood noodle place.

I went in to order in person and when I went to make my usual order I was told that I could not ask for them to exclude ANYTHING from my dish, even things I was allergic to due to the fact that all of these items were “essential to the character of the dish” and without them it would not be “correct and complete.” I was left unable to even order any food due to the pressure they placed on me.

Issei Noodle,Alexis T,3.0,a year ago,"I am Asian, so finding a good restaurant worthy of spending my money at is always a challenge. Especially in a suburban district. I’ve been holding out on a review, but this one is for the Asian community searching for authenticity! I have lived in urban areas for a long time and have had the real thing growing up in my home. This place is more of a hipster interpretation of Asian cuisine that you’d find in a city. This is not a compliment by any means. My rating for this restaurant is a low 3 only because of the variety of soups available and because of vegetable additions available (broccoli is also not authentic in ramen, but it meets the wants of the customers) I have tried the ramen, wonton, and pho here. I was patient and kept coming back to give other dishes a chance, but I am not impressed with any of the soups to be honest. I’ve given them 3 tries and each time was a disappointment. It may look decadent but the taste isn’t there. They do not taste authentic. They’re all overpriced. You can trick the locals, but I’ll be driving 25 minutes to Camp Hill, if I’m craving a real authentic bowl of  pho with the real cuts of beef. I was most upset about the special wonton soup here. The wontons were not filled with shrimp and pork. They were more like frozen bought fish cakes wrapped in wonton wrappers. There were also only 2 shrimps, 3 wontons, a sliver of bok choy and a small serving of ground park. The soup tasted like lightly seasoned pork water. For $13, it was not worth it.

Carlisle Diner,Michael Kadjeski,4.0,4 months ago,The food was good.. The breakfast special definitely filled me up for the rest of the day.  Typical weak diner coffee though.  Refills of coffee and water were prompt. Service was adequate but not friendly.  We were seated next to the dirty dishes and silverware trolley.  A bit disgusting considering the Rubbermaid cart needs a good power wash.  It must have been a very busy breakfast because the carpets were pretty dirty everywhere.  However I enjoyed my food.

Both Gyro and Beef Liver we ordered was excellent. Fries was the amongst the best we've had as well as well mixed house coleslaw and New England clam chowder I had as a starter.

The dinners come with a soup or salad and 2 sides you also can get dinner rolls. The soups are homemade and very good. I had chicken noodle. There is a lot to choose from on the menu. I want to go back and try breakfast.,1,0,0,before
Carlisle Diner,Randal Oxford,2.0,4 years ago,"I waited for about 4 minutes before being seated despite making eye contact with multiple employees, and when I was about to leave the server was really aggressive on whether or not I was staying. When I was paying my server asked if I wanted to leave a tip on my card or on the table which made me feel put on the spot like I had to give a really good tip.  I also overheard another customer say that the food he got was soggy because the cook put his toast on something like a sauce and he was pretty upset about it. Most of my experiences here have been pretty bad lately and I probably will not be eating here for quite some time.I waited for about 4 minutes before being seated despite making eye contact with multiple employees, and when I was about to leave the server was really aggressive on whether or not I was staying.

Carlisle Diner,Erin Newcomer,2.0,4 years ago,"We always love coming to the diner, especially when we’re in a hurry. The servers are attentive and friendly. However, we got sat tonight by a rude, unhospitable host. He persisted on seating three grown men at a small table and when we requested a larger table he continue to argue with us. He stated that because we were not a large party we could not sit a larger table. Mind you this was 8:30 at night and no one was there. Very poor customer service and very rude host. He needs to learn hospitality more before getting to interact with customers.We always love coming to the diner, especially when we’re in a hurry. The servers are attentive and friendly.

Carlisle Diner,Chris Witmer,4.0,5 years ago,9/2012~~The Carlisle Diner is a hometown place.  Good breakfasts at reasonable prices even with today's economy.  Lunch is good and french fries are always hot.  Some places they are sitting around all day and cold when served.  My hubby loves the senior meals...the broiled fish is huge.  I love the hamburgers!  You can get a small Greek salad which is good.  Many choices on the menu.  We just came back from FL and SC and down south it is very hard to find a local/ family owned restaurant.  So we appreciate all the family owned diners in PA.  The reason I gave 4 stars is the cole slaw was spoiled!  Serving staff should always check that. It comes in a tiny container already packaged.9/2012~~The Carlisle Diner is a hometown place.  Good breakfasts at reasonable prices even with today's economy.

Hamilton Restaurant,Jeremy Ruff,5.0,8 months ago,"The worst experience I have EVER had at the Hamilton.  I called in an order and the lady that answered the phone extremely unprofessional,mean with an attitude.  I ordered $70 worth of food which was ok.  When I said 3 hotchie dogs without the cheese she cut me off and said sir there called hot dogs not hotchie dogs.  hotchie has cheese the others are called just hot dogs.  Well I have been going to this place for 40 years, my family for 55 plus years atleast once a month or two and never have unheard that nor been treated that way.  I go to pick my order up and the lady that answered the phone said you must be the guy who called for hot dogs not hotchie dogs.  I said well sorry I never heard that before.  With an extremely stern voice and kinda loud that the whole place stopped and looked she said well next time you call in make sure you say the right thing.  I WAS LIKE WOW!!!.   my father has been ordering these this way for years....well hes wrong.  wow.  wait theres more.  An elderly lady who stood there saying hello hello mam can I pay my bill....the lady just looked at her and turned around and walked away.  The elderly turned and said this may be my last time coming in.  now by this time a man was asking for a shirt.  the waitress said to someone behind the counter..do we have anymore shirts?.  the younger girl said yes but I dont have time to go get him one. 😯.  the waitress was like ummm ok then and said sir sorry but we dont have any right now.I am not sure if Tommy or Athan was there but I doubt it because I've never seen this before while they were working.  I am only giving this a 5 star because of all the other times I was there and there food was still great.  If this was my first time there I can honestly say it would of been my last and I probably would of just walked out.  I sure hope this doesn't happen again because this place will slowly go down hill.The worst experience I have EVER had at the Hamilton.

When we had to check out, they told us that they didn't accept cards. Who doesn't accept cards at this day and age? We could barely pay since we didn't have much cash on us at that time. While we were trying to find more cash, this woman behind the cashier was smirking at us. Absolutely awful. I will not recommend this place no matter how long it's been there or how ""traditional"" it is. The staff there should be replaced. Even then, I will never go there again.I came here because my coworkers raved about how this restaurant had some good food. I came here with a friend of mine. The food was okay.

Hamilton Restaurant,Eduardo Rodriguez,5.0,a month ago,"With inflation still hiking prices up, somehow this place stays affordable.  The classic, local staple of Carlisle has a diner vibe, attentive service, a family-run atmosphere, and the most famous hotdogs in town.  Chili, cheese, onions, mustard, all on a bun housing a hotdog.  It's classic, it's delicious, and it's messy.  If you want an experience that ""takes you back"" or if you're just craving a quick, cheap bite, you can't go wrong here.  Get gravy fries as a side for a full American meal.Kid-friendliness: They definitely have kid-friendly foods.Food: 4/5  |  Service: 5/5  |  Atmosphere: 4/5Recommended dishes

I would consider it a splurge boutique restaurant. (Cocktails are all $13-$16) Staff was friendly and attentive. The building is really interesting, I would love to learn more about it. Only negatives: fries weren't quite worth the price, larger water cups would be nice (ours were filled 4 times I think), and perhaps mark the bathrooms a little more clearly. That's it, though! I would highly recommend.Dine in: Yes

My wife got the Tuna Tostada which was presented very well and appeared to be cooked properly. It was excellently flavored 9\10 on that. I made the mistake of getting the Carwood Smash burger. It seemed to be cooked somewhat decently (I asked for medium rare) but I was very disappointed with the quality. The meat seemed cheap and had many unswallowable bites, plus the flavor was very bland. 3\10... 2 stars for the overall experience, would've been better if I ordered a better dish.Mixed review.

One13 Social,Pete M.,5.0,a year ago,"Note: price included drinks.New place (open about a month when we were there.) It was very busy, and not for lack of staff.  There was about a 1 hour wait at 6pm. We were told no reservations, but they DO accept call ahead seating, up to 30 minutes in advance.  The building, previously known as The Brick, was renovated and expanded.  It was obvious that there had been a lot of effort to increase the capacity, while maintaining a nice upscale environment.We started at one of the two bars with a couple of drinks while we waited.  Craft beers and wine were priced at the higher end of average, but service was fast.We decided to have a light meal.  I had a smash burger, which was awesome.  Two others in our party had some kind of shrimp skewers, and the last person in our party had a chicken filet sandwich.  Everyone enjoyed what they ate.  Service was reasonably fast and attentive.  The owner stopped at our table to make sure everything was being taken care of properly.There was also a nice selection of dinner entrees which sounded very appealing, so we will be going back to try them.  The owner told us that these entrees may change depending upon feedback and popularity.Overall, it was a great experience.  Next time we'll call ahead to reduce our wait to be seated.

1794 The Whiskey Rebellion,Jessica Mols,3.0,6 months ago,"The ambiance of this restaurant was fantastic and our server, Dan, was extremely attentive. Overall, the food was really, really tasty. Steaks were cooked perfectly, the medallions were to die for. The salads were a bit too overdressed but the flavor was good. We kept saying we should have tried the onion rings because everyone around us had them and they looked delicious!My biggest issue, and the reason for only 3 stars, was the drinks. We were really excited to go to a whiskey bar but the whole drink experience was disappointing. My husband ordered a bourbon neat and twice it came back with floating material in it. The first time we didn't think too much of it but the second time is when we were really starting to get concerned. I really want to give the bartender the benefit of the doubt for the night, but it really looks like they need some retraining on bartending and hygiene. I watched the bartender make a drink in a shaker - they are shaking it everywhere around the bar while the liquid is flying out of it, the top portion of the shaker then fell into a glass, and they picked the shaker out by hand and then served what left in the shaker in that glass to a guest at the bar. Then I watched them put their hands on top of a beer bottle where you drink out of/pour out of and then serve it to a guest at the bar. Then I watched them I think try to juice some citrus by just rubbing it in between their hands and then throwing in a glass to serve to a guest. So after that, we were kind of over being there and were a bit grossed out. Hopefully, they were just having a bad night but it's going to take a lot for us to come back here if we are in the area again.The ambiance of this restaurant was fantastic and our server, Dan, was extremely attentive.

Our server was slammed. He was helpful with recommendations and made sure we had what we needed. The old fashioned and bourbon Betty were delicious. We started with the onion ring appetizer. Even a half portion is huge for two people. These are the best onion rings I’ve ever eaten. From the tempura to the dipping sauce, I would have probably just come here for those alone. We each got a side salad and the veggies were super fresh and again, a nice sized portion even for a side. My entree was the crab cakes and my fiancé had the wings. He said these were top notch wings and loved the whiskey bbq sauce. He got 10 and they were generously sized. My crab cakes were awesome-little filler and loved the root hash and dipping sauce it came with. The crab cakes weren’t terribly big and the root hash was sparse, but for the price I’m not complaining. The prices here are reasonable for the size you get. We each got a cookie skillet for desert, as the cookie was pretty small and thin. It tasted amazing, and the ice cream was as good as the cookie. I highly recommend checking this place out especially during the ice festival. The ice bar outside is really cool-no pun attended.

We had reservations for 2 and gave us a booth.Reservations are a must the bar and restaurant become very crowded; no packed after 5:30pm.Restaurant theme is a take on the Whiskey rebellion.  Extensive Whiskey list and whiskey flavors in most of the receipes.All that said ;The Whiskey Rebellion was a trying time in early American History.  Washington called out new American Troops in response to first large protest to the American Federal authority. Ok back to the resturant. But i understand the take on it.The Menu has a early American themed.  The waitress was knowledgeable. Lara. She explained the owner has a relationship with local farms in produce and meats. Veggies and meat all locally grown. Very excellent choice.Prices, for the crafted food it was pricey. But it was well worth going here.  I truly appreciate the skill of this resturant. In selection of ingriedients and cooked to order food.We started in ""The call to Arms"" (appetizers)""Tavern Prime mushroom"".  Very nice portabella with shaved prime rib and with caramelized onions and keswik cheese.  Came out hot and delicious.  Never had it before great starter.The main course ""The Charge"" . (Steaks).My wife ordered the ""Bastille Medallions""Fillet mignon. Wow our waitress recommended rare.  Lara said she will only eat steak at the whiskey rebellion for the simple fact they absolutely will make it right the first time.  She was correct.  My wife and I have had trouble getting steak done to our taste.  Let me say they do it right.  The fillet was warm and juicey.  Melt in your mouth. Not chewy.  The side was ""Root Hash"" nice choice carrots, parsnips, and potato.  Very tasty.My selection was the ""Molly Pitcher""(prime rib).  I know a small portion.  But if the Chef can bring out the small portion propperly as well as a large porrion I'm impressed.  Mine was cooked to rare also. The  prime rib came out warm to touch.  Perfect.  The choice of meat was the best.  Keep working with the local farms.  No hormones and pesticides.The prime rib was so soft , so juicey, melt in your mouth.  Wow. Every bite was something from Heaven.  Bravo . Now for the sides. Tastey russet mashed with a deliciulous sauce.  With the perfect change up pitch.  New long  Broccoli  spears.  Almost like. Broccoli rabe.  Crisp fresh and crunchy.   Awsome take.An additional side was the Crab cake. Not only a crab cake, the most juicey, delicate and tastey cake. Its binder was rice flour, so gluten free.  All Chesapeake Blue crab. What an excellent dish to savor. Wow.DrinksMy wife ordered the Gentleman's Old-fashioned.  It was ok.My choice was ""1794 2yr old"" supposed to be 100 proof. I think the bottle was open a while.  I was able to sniff alot out of the Glencairn glass. I was Disappointed.Next I had Jefferson 2yr small batch.  80 proof. This was just like the first. It tasted like 80 proof.  Look if your going to boast a whiskey list , it better be good.Some of the whiskey seemed over priced.But First impressions are everything.YES I SAID. GLENCAIRN GLASS.  First place ever I have been served in this glass.The owner sits you down and says ""This is My Whiskey List"".The list is atleast 75 could be more whiskeys, bourbon rue and scotch combined together nicely.The desert.I had an old fashioned ""Apple Dumpling"".Wow .  Nice crispy crust. The apple seemed to be poached.  Very nice.  With a home made ?French vanilla ice cream.  Topped with a whiskey caramel cinnamon sauce.  What an end to a truly filling and delicious meal.  Hows that for early American.Well worth the price.

1794 The Whiskey Rebellion,Hindsight22,4.0,9 months ago,"Atmosphere is nice enjoy the rustic feeling. Food was pretty good and drinks amazing. So first ordered the Dutch 75 and a Manhatten which were the best I've had, but second rounds of drinks it's as if someone just threw some ice water and splash of mix and drinks weren't great. The appetizer had the Amish Kaesespaetzle was great it's a Mac and Cheese thats cheesy with bacon and forsure worth an order. We ordered 3 main meals since couldn't decide so starting off with the best of three the beef stroganoff, has the same noodles as the Mac and Cheese with cuts of beef a gravy sauce with cheese, for sure some of if not the best rendition of stroganoff I've tasted. 2nd dish wash the Burbon Bird which had a great sauce and kind of reminded me of a sweet chili sauce more so, the mashed potatoes with cheese as well the broccoli were a great side combination tasting wonderful. Lastly ordered a Mifflin Bull Burger medium which is recommended with sweet potatoe fries, the meat was so so not making a impression and the barrel burger at Cracker Barrel was better.Huge whiskey menu if that is your thingWaiting staff was great our waitress was Mikayla (hope spelling is correct), but was attentive and helpful in deciding what to order from our choices we asked about.Overall will be back to try more menu items, hopefully crab fries will come back one day since I've heard they are amazing.Atmosphere is nice enjoy the rustic feeling.

The food was good, not great, but the killer was the inattentive service. After we told our server we needed a few minutes, we were left alone for a quarter of an hour. No one checked on us, and my daughter finally had to flag another server down to refill our water. Once we ordered, it took at least half an hour to get our burger and some ravioli. We know everyone is doing their best these days, but we were literally the only patrons ordering food. If staffing was the issue, checking in on us once or twice as we waited and waited for our food would have gone a long way.

1794 The Whiskey Rebellion,Trinten M,5.0,9 months ago,"An update to my review from a year ago. I was back in Carlisle for the GM Nationals show, my friend and I decided to stop by here again to see if there were any new libations for us to try, and possibly get some food.We were happy to see that Laurel and Milli were still there, Milli had been promoted to manager, and the old manager that had caused me to remove some stars from my review was no longer there. All good things so far!Impressively, Milli vaguely recognized my friend and I, recalling things we drank. The bar was crowded, we were seated at a two-top below the ductless mini-half-split AC. It was infrequently hitting our table with a drop of condensation, so probably just needs the drain tube cleared out or some other small adjustment. We just made sure to keep our drinks closer to the other end of the table and it was no problem.As some patrons left the bar, we migrated to those seats and had an enjoyable three or so hours of mixed drinks, 2 oz pours, and flights. The filet I ordered came out perfectly cooked. The other patrons near us were obviously regulars (given the first-name recognition by Laurel or Milli), and were friendly to talk with, which made for a great experience.This place will continue to be high on my list of options when I'm in town.An update to my review from a year ago.

They serve Coke products. The crab fries are served with a dip that has crab in it. The Deviled Eggs had 3 different types of toppings. The Johnny Appleseed Trout is served in a skillet with mashed potatoes. The prime rib and wagyu steaks were served with au jus and a horseradish sauce. The hot chocolate chip cookie in a skillet with ice cream and hot fudge is definitely worth the calories. We will return again for more delicious meals. Parking is on the street and the garage at the Comfort Suites Hotel. The restaurant is on the first floor of the hotel.Reservations are necessary for this popular dinner spot.

The potatoes were very small and the asparagus was overcooked. My wife had the seafood and frankly, the admirals feast at red lobster was ten times better at half the price. No salad or bread.

I had not received my food, after an hour, so I called the desk, and they put me in touch with the restaurant . I was told that the restaurant was slammed,  and they had pushed back all to go orders and room service, so that they could clear the  tables in the restaurant faster. Nice. I would think that people who are paying top dollar for a room would receive priority. My food arrived shortly thereafter.  No remoulade sauce for the crab cake. Asparagus which I did not order. Mashed potatoes,  which I did not order. A hasselback potato- with no butter or sour cream. The food was lukewarm. The filet I ordered medium rare, was medium. I walked to the restaurant myself to get the sauces I had asked for. The food would have been great, if it was served hot, and was what I ordered, with standard condiments.

If they drastically shrunk their menu and focused on fresh, high quality ingredients from local farms and butchers, and maybe carried more local craft beer, this place would be amazing.Beautiful historic building with art deco interior, and gorgeous, intricate woodwork.

Gingerbread Man,Steve Marshall,1.0,7 months ago,Hands down the worst experience ever that I’ve had in years. I was part of a wedding party and we decided after the wedding to stop here cuz it was close. Everyone ordered drinks. I had one beer and another drink. Asked for my tab which was 7 dollars. Gave the waitress that tab and my card. Comes back and it said I was charged 60.47 for the entire table. Asked waitress to come over and explained this is not correct. She argues with me and says you handed me all the receipts for the table. Also helped her out by closing out early cuz she said it was her shift ending. Not only did she over charge my card but had me kicked out because I told her this was not correct. Still didn’t sign giving the benefit of the doubt. Had me escorted by the bouncer outside which I said sure. Then find out she grabbed my card and swiped it for another persons tab at that table. Unethical and unprofessional. Bouncer wasn’t nice who I cooperated with. I asked to speak with a manager. Long story short. The manager argues with us about the tabs and had zero clue about what was going on. They ended up voiding the checks but they made us all feel like we did something wrong when clearly we just wanted a simple tab fixed. By far the worst experience I’ve ever dealt with at a bar. Do not go here ever. They make customers feel like they are the problem. No apology was given by the way for their mess up. Other customers were yelling in the bar about waiting for food as well while this was going on.Hands down the worst experience ever that I’ve had in years.

We walked in the door and were excited, the decor was great and the atmosphere looked like we were in for a really great dinner.

The nachos were so broken I had to eat them with a spoon because on the entire plate there were maybe 5 nachos big enough to scoop cheese and eat with fingers, nachos also tasted stale. Wings were far overdone, but the hot sauce was good. Fries were ok but hard to mess up fries. Service was poor, waitress never checked on us to see how the food was or to get drinks refreshed until about 15 min after I was empty.

They weren't busy, she and 3 other employees were eating at the table next to us. We wanted to get another pitcher, but she ignored us. At 12:15 we tried to get her attention by yelling ""checks please"" over the noise from the college students below. No response. I had to go over to her table and ask her for our checks. After handing us them she disappeared. We had to get another waitress to cash out the last check. As someone who has worked in the service business for years, I have never NOT given a tip.

This rating is solely on the service (waitress our party had today).  I have never had such poor service.  Our visit started with the waitress coming to our table to wipe the multitude of crumbs.  She wiped only half of the table and the half she did wipe she put the crumbs on the floor or on our laps.  Appalling!  We then ordered.....this went ok.  Once our food came we did not have silverware , napkins, or Condiments  we asked for when ordering.  We were finally able to wave down the waitress ( she did not come back to check on us).  We were unable to start eatting our served meal.  After waiting  an absorbent amount of time and having our food get cold i went to the bar for these items ( in all fairness I passed the waitress on my way to the bar with our requested items).  At the bar the manager did suppy our table with free beverages due to us running dry due to substandard wait service.  Overall this restaurant normally has decent service ( as I mentioned it is a frequent restaurant I patronize).  I would just hope they pay closer attention to the quality of people they hire because this waitress did not once smile or try to connect with our party or minimally ask if we needed anything.....she slammed down our requested items as though it was an inconvenience for her.  Perhaps she should find a different profession.  And I would hope the gingerbread man would take corrective action as I am confident this is how she routinely waits on tables. As i did witness her slamming down silverware at an adjacent table quite sometime after their food arrived.  I don't know....seems like such as simple task!

I never did get the name of our waitress, but she was honestly the rudest server I've ever had. I think she rolled her eyes and sighed every time she came to our table.  She asked us as a group if we were going to all be on separate checks, and we got a rude answer back when we said most of us were couples. After taking forever to get our drinks, we did get food menus. After ordering, some of us did want more drinks, but had to go to the bar to get them served, as waitress disappeared. Our food came out in waves, which with a big group is to be expected. They brought out a cali burger for one the brides, but she had order cali chicken, and the waitress was rude about fixing it. I has ordered a steak salad, but had gotten chicken. I had asked the waitress to either just charge me less for the chicken (as I was really hungry ) or bring me a little steak to add to salad. She agreed to bring me steak. So I dressed the salad and started eating it, then our waitress reappeared and took my salad saying they were going to make me a new one. WHILE I WAS EATING IT! After I got my replacement salad, the missing cali chicken appeared as our group was about finished eating.There were a few positives about this place, the food was good once we all got everything. The atmosphere was nice and our seating arraignment for a large group was nice. If I'm ever back in Carlisle, I'd go back.20 of us came to Gingerbread man after trying to find a place that would accommodate all of us on a Friday night after a wedding rehearsal.

Everything had clearly been pulled out of a fridge that it had been sitting in for too long.

Rustic Tavern,Marilyn Heck,2.0,4 years ago,"Per my husband:  Have been going to the Rustic Tavern for years for one dish, The Rustic Fettuccini Alfredo, which was the best alfredo dish anywhere. The wife and I went there for our anniversary and lo and behold they changed the recipe for this dish. I told the waitress and she said something to the chefs and they said yes they are using a different crab. The dish was not the same and I for one will not go there for this dish again. If they changed it because the crab they were using was to expensive then raise the price, don't get cheaper product this only makes a dish that was excellent into a mediocre dish you can get at any other restaurantPer my husband:  Have been going to the Rustic Tavern for years for one dish, The Rustic Fettuccini Alfredo, which was the best alfredo dish anywhere.

Several months ago, had relatives in town, and we had to wait to get a table, which we were ok with, but good thing we got our drinks at the bar.To make a long story short, took us over an hour to get our (pre-made) salads, ( 3 of us are diabetics), and when the main dishes came, all but 2 were stone cold; I truely mean stone cold.  These were not $10 plates.  When we said something to the manager, she said exactly ""I was there were she took the plates out, she took them just as we put them up on the warmer"".  This means that the cooks are not doing there job correctly as well.  She did take 1 of the meals off the receipt, but with all the extra charges on this and that, we actually paid more than what the service and food was worth.All in all, with the holidays coming up, relatives coming, and looking for a great place to take them, it got me thinking that others need to know about this place.I guess if you are a regular, you get the service, if you are not, please think twice and eat over at the Carlisle Diner, about a block away.  *Please Note:  I would not have given them 1 star, but I couldn't post without putting the 1 star on,...It took me a while thinking about this because I do not like complaining but with the holidays coming up, think somewhere else to take your family to.

That being said tonight I went with family to Hook and Flask Still Works in downtown Carlisle PA. I will start by saying that the food and drinks were top notch. From the friendly staff, to the hundred+ smiling faces of the patrons who filled literally every available seat in the place I could tell that we were in for an enjoyable evening. While the place was clearly stretched thin on staff this busy night and a few mistakes were made on our orders, we didn't mind! Why is that you might ask? We didn't mind because the staff was giving it 110% and the owner was right out there cleaning tables, delivering food to the tables and actually engaging with the customers! Tonight they had a great band ""Redemption Road"" from the Gettysburg area bringing people to their feet and truly bringing the life to the party!

When I got there to ask for carry out, they went in to ask the chef and then came back out to turn me away because they're ""too busy"" to take my order. They literally turned away a paying customer. I've never had this happen to me before. Usually restaurants will tell you there is a waiting time if theyre busy but they told me they're not going to take my order at all. Mind blown.Edit: I don't know how to respond to a response but thank you for responding. To me the logic doesnt make sense because if I decided to change my mind and sit down, you would've served me and I would have ordered the same food as I would for carry out.

Aya Japanese Steakhouse,Richard Salmeron,5.0,10 months ago,"This was an amazing place. I had been searching for a hibachi restaurant for some time and i finally came across Aya Japanese Steakhouse. Came here on a Saturday afternoon at around 3:15pm and it was pretty empty. There was 1 other couple in the entire restaurant. As soon as you walk on, you see what looks to be an authentic Japanese restaurant. The restaurant itself is split up into 2 sides. One of the sides is regular food and the other is where they make hibachi.We were lucky and we were the only ones that were there to eat hibachi and honestly i felt bad asking but that was the reason why were were there was for the hibachi experience. What can I say, we got our own private hibachi show and the chef was very skilled and talented. He told us he had been doing this for over 10 years. Food was a bit on the pricey side but honestly what you get is way more than what you pay for. The portions are big and you definitely get your money's worth. The taste was amazing and honestly I am looking forward to being able to bring my family and friends back because definitely deserves a multiple repeat visits.

Aya Japanese Steakhouse,Noah Davis,1.0,6 years ago,"Today I had received one of the most dissatisfying customer service in my life at AYA. I had waited a hour for my first plate of all you can eat sushi special. My friends had received their hibachi dinners and were half way finished with it before I received my shaggy dog sushi tray. Also we never received one refill on our drinks and we were at the restaurant for a hour and a half. Furthermore, whenever I had paid my bill the waitress made a comment to me to not to forget to leave a really good tip for her. The tip that I left  for the waitress I believe was well deserved because a waitress that barely served the customer and made me wait for a hour for sushi shouldn't receive a good tip; however me waiting for the sushi wasn't all her fault that is put on AYAs sushi bar crew. Also the waitress who waited on us would then complain to me about the tip she had received and then told me that I'm obligated to tip her twenty five percent  which is very disrespectful to your customers very poor customer service. I would understand if there was a busy crowd but there was only two other groups of people in the restaurant. Today will be the last time i will be attending AYA restaurant. Also I will be letting my friends, family and fellow co workers at giant food store know about your poor customer service. Not only did I receive the most dissatisfying service; but today was my friends second experience with your poor customer service. Very ridiculousToday I had received one of the most dissatisfying customer service in my life at AYA. I had waited a hour for my first plate of all you can eat sushi special.

Aya Japanese Steakhouse,Robin Beck,1.0,3 years ago,"This USED to be my favorite Japanese Steakhouse Until today. I took my son to celebrate his 13th birthday. The server was great. The chef, not so much. ( I've been here many times and to others too, so I know what to expect. ) Not sure what was up with our chef but his performance was lame, no actually he didnt even put on a show. No ""FIRE!"" At the beginning,  no ""volcano"" no ""fireworks"" no ""choo choo train"" no ""butterfly"" nothing. He was very much in a hurry and I'm not sure why as we were the only party there. My son, (birthday boy) ordered the shrimp and steak. His shrimp were undercooked. 🤢🤮 They offered to remake them in the back but the damage was already done. I spoke with the lady at the counter and all she did was apologize. It will be a very long time if ever we return to Aya.

Make sure you read the fine print on their coupons. You can’t combined their 2 large pizzas for $20 with a coupon. They charged us reg price for the pizzas and use the $2 off coupon, which ended up costing me $26 because I didn’t know you couldn’t “combine” the two. My husband called in to find out why I paid so much and they were so rude to him and said we should have understood the coupon better and hung up on him!!!!Delivery is awful too. We live 5 minutes down the road and waited over an hour and a half for our food. When we got it all of it was cold. My husband called and they told us to not order delivery next time.

Market Cross Pub,T CH,3.0,a year ago,"We wanted to love this place, we really did. Unfortunately it fell short in most ways. First the good. We were seated promptly and the ambiance of the place screamed old Brit pub. It was roomy and there was a section for large groups. The crab cake was tasty, though it was not made with lump crab meat. Now the not-so-good. I was disappointed by the limited number of home brews..I believe there were 4 and there wasn’t a wheat or milder lager in the mix. Both the chicken pot pie and fish in my fish-n-chips lacked salt. Also, the staff was unable to get the world football championship on the TV in the area we were in…the Brits are in a championship final for the first time since 1966…all TVs should have been locked onto the game!  The service was ok…there was a bit of a lag in attentiveness by our server…and our server made an honest mistake of charging our card for another patron’s meal. So, all in all…the experience wasn’t horrible, but it was a few steps below what we’ve experienced at other Carlisle-area breweries.We wanted to love this place, we really did.

Market Cross Pub,Christian Polster,1.0,5 months ago,"Detailed review to follow...had a terrible private event there and one of the owners dismissed the host's issues/complaints as if nothing was wrong or misrepresented.I understand employee loyalty but at the expense of customer service? Not cool MCP!________________________________________________________I will begin this by stating the staff at Market Cross was great and our hostess (Heather) was an absolute pleasure to work with and provided great customer service.Initially, our event was scheduled to be held outback on the patio/beer garden with setup completed by 6pm. Additionally, we were informed the inside party room was to be used as overflow and/or contingency for inclement weather.A cohost arrived at 6:15pm and setup was not yet complete. Furthermore, we were majorly disappointed that the event was set up inside the restaurant and not in the beer garden as previously discussed. The room was extremely warm and Heather even stated that with the buffet, it becomes very warm. Heather did take the initiative to place a fan in between the folding doors, again why we were so happy with her service. Heather was also unaware that the event was to be on the back patio, but there was not time to change the location.The patio had a foul odor from the trash receptacles, standing water, furniture was stacked and there were cigarette butts and ashes on the tables. Heather did her best to clean and accommodate us on the patio, but the area was definitely not as advertised on the website. The beer garden picture on the website has the brewery doors open with additional seating present. Market Cross mentioned “which we do not do for outdoor events unless discussed in advance”… “We do use that area for storage.” We were never asked if we needed the space but assumed it was available based on the website’s photos. The exterior fans were never turned on nor were the lights once it became dark outside which forced everybody back inside. I would NEVER recommend this area to anybody for an event in the unsavory condition that we found and used it. Unfortunately, due to our numbers and the heat inside many were forced to move outside as it was cooler.We felt we were lied to about the event being outside vs inside. Our intention was to have the entire event on the patio if weather permitted. A representative for Market Cross initially stated ”yes I will have the beer garden set up for you”, to “we do not usually set up food in the beer garden because of the flies and other insects.”It was also communicated with Heather that the tab was only for beer, wine and the specialty cocktail. She was also unaware of this and quickly went to inform the bartenders of the special cocktail. Each table had full beer, wine and liquor menus which caused confusion when guests began to arrive and order alcohol that was outside the scope of our contract and were told they would have to pay. We would have hoped for better communication early on to prevent this during our event.Lastly, the food setup inside was pretty disorganized. It appeared most food items were randomly placed, nothing was labeled as many of the guests thought the signature crab dip was potato soup. Items that belonged together were not placed near each other (i.e. pretzels and cheese dip not together or labeled). Signage would not only assist our guests in identifying what they are eating, but could also allow them to pass on to prospective clients the great food they had by name at Market Cross Pub.During discussions afterwards with one of the owners, both host’s and cohost’s concerns were dismissed and the owner was unapologetic. It is unfortunate to leave this type of review, but hope that some changes can be made to ensure that nobody else has similar issues during any future event.Detailed review to follow...had a terrible private event there and one of the owners dismissed the host's issues/complaints as if nothing was wrong or misrepresented. …More",0,0,1,post

We were patiently waiting on this holiday weekend with our group of 6, when a loud group of 4 came in behind us being obnoxious. It’s a bar, so we weren’t offended and were chatting with the group as we were all waiting. It was obvious that an uptight couple at the bar were complaining to the bartender about the whole group of 10 as we were all waiting right behind her. The bar tender was rude to us  then spoke to our waitress who had told us previously we would have a table in less than 5 min. She came back over 20 min later saying that there were a ton of reservations that she didn’t know about (when there were a ton of empty tables)and she didn’t really know what to do. We just left knowing that we weren’t wanted since they associated us with the loud group. We are loyal customers and wanted to take our 4 friends there and since we were incorrectly associated with another group of 4, we were basically turned away. It was embarrassing and disappointing.

Not sure if this is considered a health violation.Fortunately, for pitchers they used the scoop.

Market Cross Pub,Cory Giannola,3.0,8 years ago,"Good beer selection. The food was amazingly bad. Granted I made the monumentally foolish mistake of ordering the Tuscan Pasta at a pub, but why even put it on the menu if it's that bad. The pasta was overcooked and somehow dry even though it was in a butter sauce. The vegetables all tasted like they had just come out of the freezer and the chicken was tough and dry. The cheese bread appetizer was just a grocery store french loaf with Kraft shredded cheese half melted on it. I guess the fried pickles were ok, so maybe if you stick to bar/pub food you'll be okay, but the quality of the ingredients that I saw makes me doubt it.Good beer selection.

It's located on Hanover Street in downtown Carlisle. I had heard about the wing specials and was kind of excited to check it out. The beer menu is almost as large as the regular menu, they also make their very own micro-brews! We had the fish & chips, half sandwich & cup of soup, along with a dozen hot wings (I wanted to try nuclear wings, but chickened out). Service was OK, there charged us for 2 sodas, though we only ordered 1, eventually it was fixed. It's pretty much standard pub food, with a few English items thrown in (fish & chips, shepard's pie, beef pastie, tuna melt).They have food & drink specials every day of the week, as well as live entertainment.I visited Market Cross pub for Valentines Day recently.

Applebee's Grill + Bar,Sarah,3.0,7 months ago,"The main reason I'm writing this review is because of how impressed I was with the employees here. It's unfortunate that the food doesn't hold up to the quality of the employees.I'm sure we're all familiar with the average restaurant experience of the host greeting you then darting away to seat you as you try to keep up. The host that seated us today didn't do that. They walked at a slower, reasonable pace where even my father (who has mobility issues) was able to keep up. They even gave us an unexpected, pleasant ""have a good day"" as we passed them on our way to leave as they were seating another group.Our waitress was very kind and attentive. They were pretty busy with tables when we were first seated, but did a fantastic job at communicating that to us. There was even some teamwork with getting our menus & drinks as other staff swiftly brought those over. The effort and teamwork is appreciated and nice to see.Do these actions seem small? To some, I suppose. But it's these small actions that can lead to big impressions. Management should feel very lucky to have such welcoming, hard working employees. If there was a separate rating system for customer service experience, they'd get a 5 out of 5 for sure.As stated in my opening, the food doesn't hold up to the same standards. It's very overpriced for it being lower quality. Very average and unimpressive. The steak that my father got resembled a chunk off of a roast or London broil more than it did a steak. Honesty diner food trumps this place. You could probably just make it better and fresher at you home too.The main reason I'm writing this review is because of how impressed I was with the employees here.

Applebee's Grill + Bar,Nikki,1.0,6 months ago,"First, I ordered chicken tenders and fries.  They had clearly been sitting for a long time.  I was pretty irritated since that's not even cooking and any gas station can drop fried food and have it out to you, fresh, in under six minutes.  And the tenders are weirdly small and shaped in a cylinder making them look as if they belong in a kid's meal.  Seriously, Applebee's, forego five small weird ones and do three large nice adult worthy and worth the money chicken tenders.  Second, as a replacement, I ordered grilled chicken and broccoli alfredo.  There was very minimal sauce and the grill marks on the chicken are supposed to be the result of a chemical reaction between amino acids and carbohydrates when food is exposed to heat.  Instead, what I got were grill marks that were the result of a too hot or too filthy grill that left char marks that tasted burnt.  Heating the chicken in the microwave would have tasted better than what I got.  This deserves a negative star rating.  What a huge waste of time and money.First, I ordered chicken tenders and fries.

Applebee's Grill + Bar,Richard Ireland,1.0,a year ago,"What a joke! We stopped by tonight around 6pm. As we entered we noticed that the restaurant was about 30% occupied. The host asked how many was in our party. I replied that there was 2 of us. His response was that the wait time will be about 25 minutes. Once again we looked around the restaurant and noticed about 70% of the seating was not being used. When we questioned why this was so a young lady informed us that they were having staffing issues in the kitchen and staffing issues with servers.Now I certainly understand that this is a problem that all business are facing in today's world. What I don't understand is that nobody made any type of offer to seat us at a vacant table, offer us a drink, and let us have the option of waiting a longer than usual time ( which we were willing to do) but instead the only option was to stand in line at the door or leave. We chose to leave since we didn't feel like Applebee's really cared about our business or serving customer needs.While I can feel sympathetic about the problem that businesses are facing I don't feel that this was the proper way to the situation that we encountered this evening at the Applebee's in Carlise.What a joke!

My wife and I frequent this restaurant, and I am sad to say that in recent months the service has gone to hell in a hand basket.Tonight we arrived at 510. I asked for a diet Pepsi, and my wife an iced tea.We had ordered two soups as our appetizers and requested they be brought out before our food.While we were waiting the young lady serving us asked if I wanted a refill, and I asked again for diet Pepsi. Five minutes later she returns and said ""what did you want again"". To which I said ""diet Pepsi please"". She returns and says as she arrives ""oh..this is a regular... Whoops. Did you still want a diet?""My wife interjected, seeing as I was becoming visibly annoyed, and said ""sure a regular is fine"".The food didn't arrived for almost 50 mins. When It did, our entrees arrived first. I asked the runner of the food about our soups, which then arrived minutes later. I also had to ask separately for silverware because no one brought us any.The food was decent, but the service was so bad that I left there literally biting my tongue as to not say anything.I will not be returning for a LONG TIME.EDIT: I did have a positive review here prior to this evening.

I had Southwest salad with chicken and it had seasoning slabbed on it. Hot wings were dry and pretzel bites & sauce was cold. Manager came back and we complained again. Waitress was stressed out and said this is every Friday and Saturday night. We asked for the bill and she charged our bill to the other couple and their bill to us.

Finally 5 mins later the appetizers came out nice and hot and very delicious. Very quickly after our entrees came out and they were super cold and not appetizing.

I was skeptical when I heard someone was opening one in Carlisle, but sure enough, the pizza is top notch.  Besides good sauce and dough, I like that the veggies are diced on the veggie pizza. Pepperoni was nice and crispy on the pepperoni pizza.

It wasn’t until I saw a guy last week at three Pines who was telling me about your place and I said oh that’s right I forgot the name of that place I wanted to go there I was there one other time I live in Germantown Maryland he and I got into a conversation at three Pines how despicable it is that they have the audacity to charge for sides of blue cheese, or whatever sides they offer for their wings plus charge for celery I think it’s like $.50 but that’s crazy for every stock of celery. He’s making 10 bucks.Tawn runs a great bar and pardon me if I’m wrong but I think the lady that’s working there with him on this past Monday is her name is Nicole very kind very efficient works really hard I can think she’s new because she’s really trying to get her feet in for, but I can tell either way she’s great.I just want to see what you guys do a great all your food and I think it’s great. You have specials with your wings and you have beer specials. I love IPAs for only paying three dollars and was a deal! Young lady work in the kitchen works very hard I said hello to her and I could tell she puts her heart and soul into it to you my dear great job. I’m not a big fan of the smoking environment but I sit way down to the end of the bar to try to avoid the smoke. It’s not too bad it’s doable for me not my favorite thing but everything else is great. Thank you very much for everything. Love your food. Can’t wait to go back up there next time I’m fishing.This place is the best place I have been to in that area. I just wrote a review about 3 pines bar and grill.

I was not asking for free food, just maybe a discount to show we are appreciated.  Nothing.  I told her we would NOT be ordering from them any longer and she said ""ok"".  WOW is all I can say.

Miseno II Pizzeria & Italian,M& I,3.0,3 years ago,"We had them deliver to our hotel which was 8 minutes away. We were told that it would take 45 minutes to arrive and we reluctantly said ""ok"". We called exactly an hour later and someone else answered and asked ""oh didn't they tell you, it's a Thursday, so it's busy and we are telling everybody an hour and a half..."" What? ""Nooooo..."" That's what my tummy said. Anyhow, by time we got our pizza, although it wasn't hot, and was actually barely warm, I appreciated that it was fresh...in the sense, the dough, sauce, and cheese had a fresh not frozen previously for a month as some pizzas taste, feel to it, that we all enjoyed. The dough could have used some flavor, it had none really, but it did have a good bite. We asked for extra sauce and they delivered on that and the sauce itself was very tasty and made up for the dough, but the cheese, although a good portion, was undercooked to the point that we were chewing each bite for quite a while....The slices were big and the large was true to size...if it was just cooked for 5 minutes more and the crust had a touch of salt or olive oil in it, anything to give it flavor, then this would easily be 4 stars.If we are ever in the area again, we might order again, 2 hours before we are hungry, so we can get it in time.We had them deliver to our hotel which was 8 minutes away.

Miseno II Pizzeria & Italian,Kati Rudy,3.0,3 years ago,Went here tonight for our normal Sunday dinner. We decided to not only get pizza but to try other things. We were highly disappointed. We ordered 2 salads - caesar and buffalo chicken. The caesar has the basics but was nothing impressive. The buffalo chicken salad was definitely not worth it. They do not specify on the menu that the chicken is not fried before tossing in in the sauce. It is done on a flat grill so when it comes time to coat the chicken in sauce barely any of it stays on the chicken. Both salads came with cheese but again they do not specify that it is slices of cheese they cut up and put on top which melts horribly when the chicken is placed on it. I ended up wasting more than half of my salad that I probably could have made at home for half the price. Definitely will not be getting anything other than pizza again.Went here tonight for our normal Sunday dinner. We decided to not only get pizza but to try other things. We were highly disappointed.

Miseno II Pizzeria & Italian,Brad Casebolt,1.0,4 years ago,"Ordering from here wasn’t the least bit pleasant. Being from NY I wasn’t familiar with the area, but  Friday night is always busy in a college town so I picked up the order instead of waiting the 2 hours for delivery. When I called to place my order I wasn’t greeted only told “Miseno!” The short rude young lady took my order than rushed me off the phone without taking my name for the order or confirming she had written everything down correctly. Despite the unpleasant experience I was confident I would shortly be enjoying a good meal with my family.Arrival to the restaurant it wasn’t too busy maybe a half dozen tables were occupied with guests and literally 20 college age individuals on staff in the kitchen and front of house. I noticed quickly half of the staff were hanging out and talking with one another regardless of how busy this place was supposed to be. I approached the counter and was again met with an unpleasant voice which I could only assume was the young lady I spoke with on the phone. The phone was ringing a lot so again I brushed off the unpleasant feeling bc it appeared to be busy. I paid for my food and left. “Thank God that was over and done with”, I thought to myself. Only to find out once I arrived at my hotel that the order was missing some items. I called the restaurant to mend the mistake but I was simply told that everything was right according to the order. Whoops I guess I should have checked before leaving. But the issue was that I was rushed off the phone when ordering and my order was never correctly taken. The staff didn’t seem to feel empathetic to say the least and simply offered to make it if I was willing to come back and pay for the mistake. By this pint I was done with this restaurant for good and simply agreed that the service wasn’t worth my money or the 15 minute drive from my hotel. Food was decent but not worth my $30 for two entrees dripping with grease through the box. Most of it was thrown out. I will never visit this establishment again when I’m in town.Ordering from here wasn’t the least bit pleasant.

Wendy's,Caroline,1.0,a year ago,"I had the most exhausting experience as a delivery driver yesterday with this restaurant. I waited in the drive through for 42 minutes. Once it was finally my turn, they said they misheard the order and to please go back through the line again so they could work on other orders. Once I made it through a second time (which was faster, about 15 minutes), they said they didn’t have the order and it must have already been picked up. I asked for it to be remade and explained the situation to three employees who all refused to remake it because “we can’t make an order twice”. Finally, an employee at the window said that turns out they heard me correctly the FIRST time through and had the order the whole time, hence it being erased from the screen of the people claiming it was picked up.

Wendy's,c b,4.0,a year ago,"Used the online car side to go app. It was a longer than usual wait and drive thru had us blocked in a few times. This resolved by cars going through the line or pulling away for what ever reason. Other cars were in the curbside pickup also. Some people were parking there and going in to get their food. I was unable to add an item through the app, so I called the store as soon as I parked and they helped me with that issue, I might add.

Wendy's,Ian Lee,1.0,5 years ago,"So my mom and I go in at about 9:00 pm. We go in, decide what we want. The woman working the counter was busy, which was fine. This woman was about 5' 3"", in her 60s, has short hair and glasses. My mom realized she forgot wallet, so she goes to get it while I order, knowing what she wants. The cashier comes over to my order and I explain that I want a 4 for 4 with double stack wanting no ketchup or mustard on it and that my mom wants a small fry and double stack with only ketchup and mustard. At first the woman taking our order didn't understand, so I reexplained. She then asks if I want a double stack with nothing on it and I repeat how I wanted the double stack. She starts getting impatient for some reason, and slightly starts talking rude. At the point I'm a bit irritated and am getting impatient too. My mom walks back in, and while this woman doesn't know what she's doing, I tell my mom I've tried ordering three times already. The cashier finally gets it right, almost, on the fourth try. She has the 4 for 4 with the correct doublestack, a small fry, but with two extra doublestacks with only ketchup and mustard. I then say we only want one extra. She then takes it off the order and it is finally correct on the 5th try. But then she walks away to the back and says to another employee, ""I need your finger."" We did not understand what she was asking of the other employee. She then tells the other employee to delete everything, and before they do, we tell them that the order was correct. But, they still delete it. The other employee walks away and the cashier then says ""let's try this again."" So I, for the 6th time, try to explain what we want. She then looks at my mom and says, ""Maybe you can explain this better."" At this point, I was absolutely pissed and tell my mom, ""I'm not taking this any more, let's go.""So my mom and I go in at about 9:00 pm. We go in, decide what we want.

Taco Bell,Thomas Jones,1.0,4 months ago,"They've been at this location for forever, now. They were closed for renovations, but other Yelpers reported it as permanently close, so can't leave reviews on their original page. Given their prior reviews, the Ownership is probably happy enough to have been able to jettison those reviews.Wish I could say that things have improved with the renovations, but they decidedly have not.Hopped into the drivethrough line a few minutes before 1600. There was one car sitting at the (cash) payment window (seriously: why have a window just for cash payments but have credit-card users pay AT the food delivery window???), me and another car at the two, parallel order kiosks. I ordered two soft taco supreme meals - one with beans instead of ground beef the other with steak instead of ground beef - each with a water. On the menu, one showed up with the ""Sup"" tag while the other did not. Asked the order-taker if both were actually Supremes. She assured me they were. Both were the same price, so I shrugged and moved on. Went to the first window and, after waiting 10ish minutes for the car that was there to move on, get told by the person there ""this is the cash window""(???) ...ooookaaay. Takes a further ten minutes for the car ahead of me to get done paying for and receiving her food. Get to the window, hand them my card. I say to my wife, ""check the bag to make sure they made the correct meat substitutions"". They eventually hand me my card back followed a minute later by our bag. Slow, but still far faster than the previous vehicle. I was momentarily happy that we'd gotten our food so quickly after such an extraordinarily long was (during not lunch or dinner rush - go figure). I pull up so next car can get complete their transactions and pause so wife can inspect the food order for correctness. She tells me the meats were correct, so I drive out of the lot. We're about a block away when wife notes that the food was cold ...presumably because it had been waiting in a bag for 10 minutes while the person ahead of us sorted out their order. Sub-ideal, but not a ""turn the heck around and try to get an actually warm order"" - it's Taco Bell so warm or cold isn't really going to make much difference on enjoyableness.By the time I get home, I'm quite hangry. Open my food up to find that my ""Supreme"" tacos are a few chunks of ""steak"", lettuce and a bare *hint* of cheese. Not what I'm used to when I order a ""Supreme"". Wife's tacos are just fine.So, 20 minutes to get cold ""fast"" food that's incorrectly made. Wish I'd have ordered through DoorDash or whatever as I could have gotten a refund on the food.They've been at this location for forever, now.

Taco Bell,Shawn Batdorf,1.0,4 months ago,"When I went last week. I had ordered through the app. It was my first time going there since it reopened. I got in the parking lot, get out of my car, and start walking to the door. Before I got to the door, I can see inside about 10 other people standing there in ordering area. I thought, ""That's not a good sign"". I walk in and some of the other customers notified me that it's gonna be a long wait. About 40minutes for some of them. I had already ordered and paid for it. Also I didn't have anything to that day so I had time. So I was gonna wait.While I was waiting, the one girl there was taking charge. I don't know if she was a supervisor or like a bench pick. Either way she was doing the best she could. Same with the other employees there. I could see they were trying with what they could. The problem they were having is that they were short staffed. When they closed the location down to rebuild it, all the staff left of course. I felt bad for the employees and I wasn't going to blame them. I still don't blame them. They're short staffed.I think what's worse was that I heard her making phone calls to what sounded like a manager. Not totally sure on that. That made me think. ""It's two in the afternoon. Yet they don't have a manager on staff. A manager should be here stepping in. They need help. Leadership should be here making an example."" It's bad enough that there was maybe six people back there. Then, you add that there is no manager on staff. I over heard her saying that there was four managers on staff at the grand opening. Maybe there was something going on with them. I don't know. Point is though that there really should be at least one manager on shift with the rest of them. Especially now.I ended up waiting almost two hours before I just left and went to McDonalds down the street. I didn't really care to ask for a refund at that point. I hope they get the staff that they need and with the proper training. I also hope they get some management with an actual backbone. The aptitude to help out when needed and to actually take charge.Service: 1/5  |  Atmosphere: 4/5When I went last week.

The lady called my first name and I was unsure it was mine. They’re was no receipt or invoice stating my name or the contents included. Upon inspection of the bag I noticed there was an item I did not order. I was very confused. But everything that I ordered was there. Except my drink. I had to ask for my cup. Several people in front of me and behind had to do the same. When I asked the lady I received a rather indignant response. She also muttered something under her breath and I was unsure what was said. It’s not my fault they don’t have the cups ready. How am I supposed to eat my tacos without a Baja blast. This rubbed me the wrong way. The soda machine had buttons which you have to touch with your finger. This spreads germs. What happed to the type where you could just push the cup in. The tables were small and the chairs were made for little people. The food was as good as Taco Bell can be.  The bathroom was clean and the toilet had good pressure.

Taco Bell,Morgan Mufalli,1.0,2 years ago,"Any other time I would give this place a 5 star service but today I was highly disappointed in this establishment. I even know some of the employees personally and they always make sure to provide the best service possible. I also work in the food industry and can completely understand rude customers or Karen’s as they call them, but tonight was ridiculous and uncalled for. When arriving at Taco Bell naturally they were busy dealing with their dinner rush and such which Is understandable any restaurant deals with this daily. I ordered a fairly large order and everything was completely correct and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Then when I arrived home my mother, who had ordered two crunch wrap supremes (which would usually get nacho cheese), my mother doesn’t care for the nacho cheese so we always order them with the 3 cheese blend in which we assumed were made correctly since we don’t usually have problems with them. Upon arriving home my mother opened them up to check. Well both of them were made wrong. I tried calling the establishment and got a busy signal so we just decided to drive back and have them remade since now my mother no longer had anything to eat for dinner. I asked to just have them switched out I wasn’t worried about any extra compensation or anything. Just simply wanted them remade. The what I’m going to assume general manager Pam approached me with a ridiculous attitude and when I explained everything nicely she instantly questioned me and asked if I just “didn’t know what I was talking about” because she “watched them put the correct cheese on them” that’s fine but the cheese that I specifically ordered was not added or substituted in any way. I’m also an assistant manager and I know that in the food industry you never question your customers you simply do your best to make them happy cause after all “the customer is always right”. I also tried calling up to corporate but they were sadly closed I will be calling in tomorrow to solve this because I feel completely disrespected and you should never make your customers feel that way.Any other time I would give this place a 5 star service but today I was highly disappointed in this establishment.

We had to sit at a dirty table which is very dangerous during this pandemic. After we sat down he eventually came out and started to clean the tables while he was complaining the whole time.

Taco Bell,Katy E,1.0,a year ago,"I just had the worst experience that I’ve had in quite some time at this Taco Bell. For starters, I placed my order, went through the drive thru, and was told to pull around to wait for my order. Fair enough; it was 10pm and it was understandable to have to wait for a little bit. I waited for about 20 minutes, while the Taco Bell workers decided to have social hour and forget about the several orders that they had (I could tell that she had forgotten from the surprised look that she had when she saw that 2 cars were in the front of the lot). She comes out with the food, and completely mixes up the orders. We quickly figure this out and get it fixed, not a big deal. After finally getting the correct order, we notice that one of our items was completely missing, another was made wrong. We go back through the drive thru to correct this, which takes some more time (it’s after 10:30 by this point). After getting the correct items, it is even more obvious that the worker forgot the first time; this food is WAY more fresh than the limp, cooling food that was sitting in the bag. I get home to eat it, and my god, would it surprise you to know that not only was the grease and juice leaking through the packaging, but another item was incorrect and I had missed it? And I live 15 minutes away, so I don’t have time to go back that late at night. I am boycotting this Taco Bell for a while. I have not had any issues with them in the past, but this just took it to a whole new level. I work in a restaurant myself and I understand the stress that can fall on workers, and I am certainly not trying to negate that. However, I think the employees need to be properly trained on how to work in customer service. I have had times where I don’t want to be at my job. But you should never let that show.I just had the worst experience that I’ve had in quite some time at this Taco Bell.

After receiving the exorbitant bill, a member of my dining party asked to speak to the manager, to discuss the discrepancies. To my knowledge, a manager never arrived, instead, a member of the staff appeared and gave the illusion of being in charge. Nothing was really solved with our problems with the meal itself. Turns out another member of the staff, Jeremy, decided to make a very petty and unprofessional decison to involve personal matters that were none of his business, to ruin our evening.

Café Bruges,Eduardo Rodriguez,4.0,3 years ago,"While the food is delicious and the imported beer is great, you also pay for it.  The pricing is a tad high, but the taste is what you pay for.  The downside is that this restaurant is in high demand, they don't take reservations, and the  temperature inside is hotter than a normal restaurant.  Expect to leave with an oily sheen on your skin.  The biggest drawback is that if you have a party over 4 they fill tables of 2 and 4 first, and so you could be waiting for an hour in a crowded little area with a single bench.  The experience will change entirely for smaller groups, where you can be seated and served faster.  It isn't first come first serve for wait times.  An example: I arrived in a party of 6, the wait list had our name on the top of the list.  After witnessing all the 2 and 4 tops under us get seated first, we decided to leave after an hour.

The food I've order here was cooked to perfection. I particularly enjoy the Trappist burger because the flavors they add make it taste really good and the chef cooks it the way I like hamburgers, medium rare which in my opinion is easy to mess up, but the chef working at Cafe bruges is absolutely amazing. The muscles are also very enjoyable and I really want to stress that because finding good seafood in Pennsylvania is very difficult. I asked one of the waitresses where they get their muscles from and she told me there is a muscle farm somewhere in PA.

The restaurant itself was pretty elegant and the walls were adorned with pictures of homes, markets, streets and boats in Bruges, Belgium. They had banners & posters hanging displaying the names of some of their beers. It was pretty loud as noted by other reviewers, but not crazy.We ordered the following food as our entree we had the waterzooi of fish, which was basically a stew of shrimp, scallop & snapper, potatoes, carrot, leak & celery for 18.00. As an appetizer we had the Liege salad, which didnt have any lettuce at all, but consisted of green beans, potatoes & bacon bits in a sauce (8.00) and lastly we shared an order of frites with curry ketchup (5.00).I enjoyed my visit because of the atmosphere and the fact that it unique. Service was fine, but I wasnt so thrilled with the cost of the items or the portions, they were OK, but not large (minus 1 star), and the entrees didnt come with any sides. (minus 1 star) I didnt have the chance to have a drink, but the beer selection was nice: Bavik, Winterkerke, Stella Artois, etc.I'll be back Im sure, I'd like to try the Belgian Waffle, Crepes and/or some of the desserts!

With the price of vegetables and meat at the grocery stores being so high, it was amazing that the prices here are not high at all (unless you're getting a specialty item). You can get a healthy meal for an affordable price. The spice levels are included for each item - remember, Thai spicy is a whole other level from western spiciness. Highly recommend the somtum (green papaya salad), Larb, and Massaman curry. Their kopi (Thai Iced Coffee) is fantastic.

The good: the rice was prefect, the curry tasty, and they got the spice level exactly as I ordered it (a rare event.) Lot's of choices on the menu. The not-so-good: the service was leisurely, though not as painfully slow as previous incarnations at the site, even though they were not very busy. Their air-conditioning was set to somewhere between meat-locker and Arctic blast. The food was bit too salty for me, but that is a personal preference. The prices were on the high side, but not outrageous. The bad: I would definitely return, but my wife started hurling about six hours after we ate, and continued for another 24 hours.

Massaman curry is fantastic, chicken satay is out of this world. ‘Spicy’ scale is maybe a smidge higher than what we’re used to; mild is perfect for me and the medium is enough for my husband, who gets spicy everywhere else.

John's Hideaway Restaurant,Crystal Oakman,5.0,5 years ago,"So at first glance you might think this place isn't worth it, but you'd be wrong. Look. There are no modern frills. It feels like an old diner, complete with a menu with things like liver & onions and fried ham, and a clientele which has been coming here for decades. And if you just looked at that, what with ""diners"" nowadays being all fancy, and what we used to call regular food now out of fashion, you would miss that the food is home cooked, the staff are welcoming, and the locals are filled with the best stories. Sure the menu is no frills, but it's delicious. I think we lose some of that simplicity in modern restaurants. Everything nowadays is deconstructed or has a name you can't pronounce, which don't get me wrong I like on many occasions. But there's a place for simplicity. And this place....This stuff is grandma proud, good ol comfort food. You want some of the best meatloaf or fried chicken ever, sitting among locals rip roaring it up in an extremely casual environment at a good price? This is it, and I hope it stays. Otherwise, we lose the refined elegance in simple, home cooked food, which is something no town should be without. And PS, if you really want to hear some great banter, head in around 6am. Those folks have THE best time, and the sausage is the best in town.So at first glance you might think this place isn't worth it, but you'd be wrong. Look. There are no modern frills.

Taqueria Laurita,Avid Book Reader,3.0,a year ago,"Objectively, the food is good if you are a foodie and just like good food. If you are Latina and are looking for a bit of home, then you will be disappointed. The original owners are Hispanic but they sold their business to new owners. The new owners are a mixture- one American and one Latino but not from Mexico, which is okay cause like I said the food is still good if you like good food. But if you are looking for a pure Mexican taste then you need to go somewhere else. But if you enjoy good food and nice people, then check them out. My only concern is they have the Mexican flag out in the front of the store that needs repair. In honor of the people of Mexico and the original owners, they will need to get a new flag and respect the culture completely in order for me to move my 3 star rating to a 5 stars. Other than that, if you need a quick lunch, why not stop in for some good tacos.Objectively, the food is good if you are a foodie and just like good food.

Seeing peas in my burrito threw me off a bit, but didn't harm the flavor. My main gripe is that it's an hour or so later now, and my system seems to want the burrito gone.

Taqueria Laurita,Hram Irez,4.0,4 years ago,"Delicious tacos in an informal setting. We ordered a selection of tacos to include cow tongue, steak, fish,  and chorizo.

I don't think I've ever eaten it like that and I didn't care for it. It is served with mayo.  With as much corn as it is grown here,  I thought I'd find elotes. They don't have any.

The Pizza Grille - Carlisle,Charisse Morrell,4.0,2 months ago,"We've eaten at Pizza Grille multiple times, under different circumstances (date night, take out, celebrating with family, etc) and have had good experiences. The one  constant is that the food is excellent. Some of the menu items are a little pricey, but whether it's a salad, pizza, sandwich, or entree, it's always been really good.The wait staff are young and seem kind of inexperienced overall - just not a lot of attention to detail, personality, or customer service common sense (things like seating you RIGHT NEXT TO the only other occupied table in the whole restaurant or not even offering a high chair when one is clearly needed). Sometimes it requires a little extra patience on our behalf as patrons, but we've never had any major problems.Other than that, we were very caught off guard that Pizza Grille does not have a kids' menu. If you eat with children, you're required to order a small pasta or pizza, which is waaaayyyy more than a kid can eat. So that puts you in the position of sharing a plain cheese pizza or bowl of noodles and red sauce OR over ordering and paying more for an adult-portioned dish. Not ideal, we won't be back with kids. Aside from that, we'll continue to come back (most likely for take out) because we enjoy the food.Kid-friendliness: There is no kids' menu.Dietary restrictions: Gluten free options.We've eaten at Pizza Grille multiple times, under different circumstances (date night, take out, celebrating with family, etc) and have had good experiences.

The menu had something for everyone.  The food was very good.... but what made this place ""stand out"" to me was Bret.  My friend and I talked and talked and talked. Later, Bret came out to turn the light on apologizing for letting us in the dark since the sun had gone down.  We hadn't even noticed! When we finally decided to leave, there was no one else in the restaurant except Bret, obviously waiting for us to leave.  He never made us feel rushed or that we needed to get out.  We apologized to him for making him stay and he said ""no problem at all, I heard her say she hadn't seen you for awhile and I heard you say you needed to get out of the house so I just left you two go"".   I don't think I've ever had a server THAT attentive, that he KNEW what we needed.

The Pizza Grille - Carlisle,J S,2.0,3 years ago,"Let me start by saying the food is some of the best food in the area.  The sandwiches are delicious and the ""make your own pasta"" is fantastic as well. Our concern is with a safety and potentially very dangerous issue.  Since last year there have been three separate times when we were served sandwiches with the bamboo toothpicks in them.  On those three occasions a small piece of bamboo (1 inch or so) was either found inside the sandwich or on the plate under or beside the sandwich (where the salad's located).  If someone would not see those pieces of bamboo they could easily eat and swallow them and who knows what could happen?  A lawsuit waiting to happen.  We brought it to the attention of the managers of the Camp Hill and Carlisle restaurants where it happened but so far nothing's been done about it.On another occasion we were served water in a clear glass that had a huge crack along the side of it.  Fortunately we saw it before anything bad happened and brought it to the attention of the manager as well.Both of these issues are easy to remedy...do not use real glass glasses and use another type of toothpick for the sandwiches.Like I said, the food's great, the atmosphere is wonderful and the staff is friendly and courteous.Let me start by saying the food is some of the best food in the area.

The Pizza Grille - Carlisle,Nissa Van Riper,5.0,5 years ago,"We adore this place and eat here most every week because...life. The owner cares about the food and some of it is locally made (cheesecake from a Carlisle baker, focaccia bread fresh from Philly). The menu is diverse so that we always feel like there is something enticing for each of us. Even eating there so often there is enough variety. If you like to eat ""veg-forward"" you will have options. If you want a local, grass-raised steak, they've got it. Nearly 30 different pizzas, from regular old pepperoni to gyro to spicy shrimp to arugula&prosciutto to five cheese. Or design your own with many interesting topping choices like carmelized onions or feta cheese. And all pizzas come full- or individual size so each diner can have her own. Several fun salads plus the standards. Hub's fave dinners are the butternut squash ravioli (and it is perfection) or the salmon. I could go on and on.The staff is attentive and fun. They notice if you don't eat something and genuinely care if you didn't like it and they'll offer a replacement or take it off the bill immediately. (Only happened once to us and we've eaten there at least 50 times.) The staff have all been there a while (it doesn't turn over) so they know us and we know them--in the best possible way--like would happen at small neighborhood place. They treat each other, and us, like family. They offer a 20% military discount which is super generous and which we totally appreciate.The space is not what I would call cozy. It's more industrial. We love that they have big garage doors they open when the weather is nice. Parking is plentiful. Access is easy. Kitchen is semi-open. Two TVs and a bit cozier in the smaller dining area.It's BYOB but the liquor store is literally next door and they sell singles, six packs, and whatnot.

The crust  was underdone, the sauce underwhelming, the cheese almost tasteless, the ""Italian chicken sausage"" was chopped up chicken sausage links vs crumbled Italian chicken sausage. They're aspiring to be a gourmet pizza spot, but they need to invest in a wood fired oven and better sauce and cheese (and chicken sausage).

Fay's Country Kitchen,Thomas Boyd,5.0,a year ago,Enjoyed the experience here because I liked the atmosphere and the food. According to our waitress said they are known for their skillets and pecan pancakes. I ordered the fiesta skilled eggs over easy with raisin bread and 1 pecan pancake. My wife ordered the special (see picture). Our waitress was very attentive in spite of being busy and the food came out hot and fresh. The price and quality beat most places locally. The decorations are fun and a throwback with lots of old coke product stuff. They also have hand sanitizer at each table.Enjoyed the experience here because I liked the atmosphere and the food.

The egg tasted pretty good, not dry at all, I did add a tad more salt. The home fries were pretty potato-y for me. The toast was amazing, nicely buttered! The other dish was the Fiesta Skillet.

I remembered that the place was cash only so I got some cash out of the ATM and sat down. One employee walked over and handed me a menu and just said ""Let me know when your ready."" I nodded, looked at the menu and placed an order. My food came out and everything tasted dry and lacked any real flavor, like everything had been overcooked. I got scrambled eggs, bacon and homefries. None of it tasted good at all...What bothers me is noone who was there seemed to care like they were just there for the sake of being there, that is not a good impression to give a customer. To be fair, food service is hard. People are usually underpaid, under appreciated and live pay-check to paycheck and only able to get the really important things based on what they make off of tips. I do food service..., but I am never coming back here. My boss would have been all over the entire team for looking like we don't care.

Omelet and corned beef hash were very good and came quickly.  Only issue was, I asked for Swiss cheese on my omelet and was told they ""don't have it for omelets"" which I assumed meant they don't have it.  When I checked out, I made a comment that I found it odd they didn't have any.  The cashier told me they had it, but it gets ""too confusing on weekends"" and they only have one kind of cheese for omelets.  I questioned how that applied to me, and she was quite flippant, telling me ""if I listened I would have understood"".  Needless to say, even though it was a pleasant and tasty meal, I WILL NOT BE BACK!  Perhaps they should hire some more competent staff so different cheese on an omelet doesn't cause too much chaos and rudeness.

Fay's Country Kitchen,Paul Taylor,2.0,3 years ago,"Stopped on a Tuesday around 10AM. Would not choose to stop again. Ham looked nice but tasted a bit sour like it was getting ready to turn. Used mustard to mask the flavor. Home fries good, except I was given onions on them after I had declined the offer to add onions.  Waitress checked her order pad while she stood there to make sure about no onions (uncomfortable). Rye toast cut thinner than regular and costs 25c upcharge.  Jelly bin was completely full of grape only.   The toast was barely browned, and was soaked with bright yellow butter-flavored griddle oil, even though I asked for peanut butter instead.  Then I was charged 50c for a tiny plastic cup of PB.Why charge your customers for something different, especially when the competition doesn’t?  Upcharges are customer repellent, especially when the patron makes a choice because you are out of something they would have liked.  I didn’t charge for my personal time while I sat there waiting to have my potatoes corrected, as my wife ate her breakfast without me.Pancakes had a gummy consistency, not fluffy as buttermilk should be.  Scrambled eggs were brownish and flat, maybe the eggs were mixed a while ago. Bacon was dense and pressed perfectly flat except one corner folded over hard, like reheated from previously cooked and at the bottom of the stack of cooked meat. Orange juice OK.  Coffee good. Restaurant was clean. Portions good. Wait staff good and stay out front. We received a bill without the total added up.So the food is not freshly cooked, except the sunny eggs. Service fine, but we were only one of about four tables. If there is not much business, why not cook fresh?  This is why we stopped, and will not bother again.  Eating out should be special for guests instead of being convenient for the cooks.Stopped on a Tuesday around 10AM. Would not choose to stop again.

I travel down from Enola once a month for a skillet. One other great thing is that they are cash only. I miss that in a world that is working towards going cashless. There is a fair amount of seating for a local joint. Street parking surrounds the restaurant. I have not delved deeply into the remainder of the menu though I am sure it is tasty. Their skillets are my thing. There are quite a many diners in Carlisle. Fay's stands out with old world charm. Check it out!Food: 5/5  |  Service: 5/5  |  Atmosphere: 5/5Recommended dishes

We stumbled upon this little gem by accident and had never tried this type of cuisine but our server was absolutely lovely and took the time to answer all our questions and make recommendations.  We started with the plate of variety Momo's which were served with a delicious dipping sauce with just the right amount of heat.  I choose the beef Datsi & my husband had the Thimphu.  Both dishes were extremely flavorful and came out in a timely manner.  For dessert we shared the Kheer (Himalayan rice pudding).  Do yourself a favor and give this gem a chance.

Yak N Yeti II,Fifty2weekhi,4.0,4 years ago,"Very ethnic ambiance, and an unfamiliar one to boot.  For that alone, it scores a point as a special place to impress your date.  There are murals everywhere on the walls, banisters, and posts. There's even a section of tables where you can sit on the floor on a cushion.We were greeted and seated quickly. The 2 wait staff were very friendly and helpful.  We were given a brief instruction on the menu: how it's divided between Nepalese and Bhutanese dishes, as well as vegetarian vs. non-vegetarian; how a special icon is used denote popular dishes at their flagship restaurant in New Cumberland, etc.For the appetizer, we ordered the Napali Fries $5.95. It reminded me of poutine without the cheese. Looked appetizing, tasted great; crispy outside and creamy inside.  Highly recommended.For entrees, we ordered 2 Nepalese and 1 Bhutanese.  All came with a side of cabbage slaw and steamed red rice which was nice but I thought the serving could have been bigger.Chicken Sizzler $12.99.  It's served on a cast iron sizzle plate and came with a ""fanfare"". It's colorful and looked almost like a vegetarian dish as the cubed chicken breast resembles fried potatoes among colorful bell peppers and onions.  I didn't care much for the sweet and sour taste though, so it was alright.Kathmandu Fried Chicken $11.99.  There were about 5 pieces of fried chicken. Excellent taste. Meat was moist and batter was crispy. Recommended.Shakam Datsi $11.99. I was told the Ema Datsi would be very spicy, like 12 on a 1-10 scale. So we ordered this one instead with special instruction to put just a little bit of chili. That was a wise decision because even this toned down version got my sinus running. However, the datsi dried beef was much tougher than beef jerky, very punishing on the teeth.  So it was unfortunately a disappointing dish.Overall some hit and misses on this visit. I plan to come back and try their momos and sample more dishes.Very ethnic ambiance, and an unfamiliar one to boot.  For that alone, it scores a point as a special place to impress your date.

North Hanover Grille,Jacob Sailer,1.0,2 weeks agoNew,"I used to go here for lunch quite often and decided to stop back in today. Beginning to wonder why I ever bothered to in the first place...service is lax but acceptable.They pour a decent pint and there's usually something local and craft or imported that's worth drinking on tap. Would never recommend ordering a cocktail here, at most a pour of whiskey on the rocks, and the wine selection leaves a lot to be desired.Food was awful, with the most pathetic Cubano presented to me for consumption. Dry, stale even, bread, overcooked and flavorless pork, and no ham in sight. Fries were at least fresh, but not worthy of note, would have preferred the chips since at least those are crisp. It's at least feels spacious, but they constantly have one particular TV on with sound that just plays Fox News forever, so it's the only thing you (kind of) hear. I would say go only for the beer but there's far better places to do so, including craft breweries.Will never return.Food: 1/5  |  Service: 2/5  |  Atmosphere: 1/5I used to go here for lunch quite often and decided to stop back in today.

Ordered a couple of beers for my husband and I while we looked over the menu. Started off with a dozen wings two different flavors, they were great! My husband got a dinner special, I went with a crab cake sandwich with f.f. Everything was absolutely   💓 except for the f.f. I was a little shocked really that they were cheap frozen stock fries. However, the Kaiser roll,  my lump meat crab cake came on and the cake itself was superior! The crab cake was plentiful and full of flavor, just enough breading to hold it together!  My husband's salmon dinner special with brussel sprouts were fantastic! Beer was cold. Service and I'm going by what our check said who we were served by was Teri and she was amazing! Hit every point someone in the industry should touch base on. Perfecto! We would most definitely become a regular patron of this restaurant if we lived here and will surely mark it in our travels as a place to come back to when we are here again.
